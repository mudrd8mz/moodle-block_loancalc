Legendary loan calculator for Moodle
====================================

The loan calculator block allows users to calculate loan parameters. Given the
interest rate, repayment frequency and two of three other parameters (amount
of loan, repayment amount and loan term), the block calculates the third
parameter.

Sounds cool, right?

* The block had been part of standard Moodle distribution since 2005,
  originally as blocks/student_loan_calc.
* It was removed from core in 2010 (MDL-18011) and Moodle 2.0 was released
  without it, leading to [strong emotions in the
  community](http://www.moodlenews.com/2011/rip-the-loan-calculator/).
* In 2013, Arnaud Trouvé [updated
  it](https://github.com/ak4t0sh/moodle-block-loancalc) to work with Moodle
  2.x.
* On 1st April 2016, David Mudrák published a fresh new version compatible with
  Moodle 3.0, using the cutting edge Moodle development technology (AMD,
  Mustache) and this new version was available at moodle.org's English
  community page.
